Hello! I am currently enrolled at South China University of Technology and will receive my Master of Engineering degree in 2026.

## Research Interests 🔬

My research interests primarily focus on computer vision, including:

- **Controllable Video Generation** : Exploring techniques for controllable generation of high-quality video content
- **Fine-grained Instruction-based Image Editing** : Developing intelligent image editing methods with fine-grained action instructions
- **Multimodal Large Models** : Investigating post-training strategies and next-generation architecture design for large-scale multimodal AI
- **Unified Multimodal Models (UMM)** : Exploring schemes where generation tasks and understanding tasks mutually enhance each other

## About Me 👋

I am a passionate researcher dedicated to artificial intelligence and computer vision. During my graduate studies, I have been committed to exploring the applications of deep learning in visual understanding and generation tasks. I believe that multimodal AI technology will bring revolutionary breakthroughs to future artificial intelligence systems.
